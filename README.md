# Web-Scraping-Project---Python-Assignment-2

Rotten Tomatoes is a popular American review aggregation website that compiles reviews from professional critics and provides an overall percentage score called the “Tomato meter.” It serves as a valuable resource for moviegoers and film enthusiasts to gauge the critical reception of movies and TV shows.

Web scraping is a powerful technique that allows us to extract valuable data from websites. In this project, we will focus on utilizing Python to scrape data from the renowned review aggregation website, Rotten Tomatoes, to obtain the “Best Shows of 2023.” By automating the data retrieval process, we can save a considerable amount of time and effort compared to manually collecting the information. Python’s versatile libraries, such as BeautifulSoup and pandas, will enable us to navigate through the website’s HTML structure, extract the relevant data points, and organize them neatly in an Excel sheet. With this approach, we can easily analyze the critical consensus and audience reception of the top TV shows released in 2023, gaining valuable insights into the year’s most acclaimed television content.
